# Zero-shot Named Entity Recognition (NER) on historical texts from Project Gutenberg

1. Install and import the required libraries: You'll need to install and import the transformers library, which is a Python library for natural language processing using pre-trained models.

2. Load the zero-shot NER model: The transformers library provides a pre-trained zero-shot NER model that you can load using the pipeline function.

3. Define the labels: The zero-shot NER model requires you to define the labels you want to extract. For example, if you want to extract people, locations, and organizations, you would define these labels as a list.

4. Process the input text: You'll need to preprocess the input text to remove any unnecessary characters, convert it to lowercase, and tokenize it into individual words.

5. Define the candidate labels: You'll need to define a list of candidate labels that might appear in the input text. This list can be generated from a knowledge base, such as Wikipedia or a database of named entities.

6. Use the zero-shot NER model: You can use the zero-shot NER model to predict the presence of the defined labels in the input text. This is done using the pipeline function, which takes the input text, the candidate labels, and the defined labels as input.

7. Extract the named entities: The zero-shot NER model returns a list of predicted labels and scores for each label. You can extract the named entities by selecting the labels with the highest scores.

8. Display the named entities: You can display the extracted named entities to the user, along with any additional information, such as the entity type and score.
